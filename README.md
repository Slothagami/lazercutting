# Lazercutting Designs
I just realized you can create SVG's for a lazercutter programatically. The best Ideas I came up with are here, including:
- Riemann Hypothesis Coaster (Of the Critical Line)
- Mandelbrot Set cutout
- serpinski carpet (complete to the finest detail of your lazercutter)
- gosper curve coaster
